Its on time percentage is 2 higher than Alaska's, and its delay percentage is 2 lower, despite having much more traffic overall. This is due to the airline being located near the west coast, making it geographically more efficient for handling flights in that region such as Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Diego. In constrast, Alaska has much more flights arriving San Francisco and Seattle, which are Northern cities. The on time percentage for these areas (85.1% and 85.8% respectively) are much higher than AM West's (71.3% and 76.7% respectively). In conclusion, the overall data may suggest that AM West is the better airline, but it does not factor in location as a contingency for timeliness. Therefore, the data provide is not sufficient to make a definite statement on which airline is better.",
